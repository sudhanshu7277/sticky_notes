for our products.
When assessing the results of your work, we will be paying most attention to the
architecture and design of the application, performance, code quality, accuracy
of static typing, and usability.

Sticky Notes
------------
Your task is to implement a single-page web application for sticky notes. You
are required to implement at least 3 of the following 4 features:
1. Create a new note of the specified size at the specified position.
2. Change note size by dragging.
3. Move a note by dragging.
4. Remove a note by dragging it over a predefined "trash" zone.
You are encouraged to think about the best UI for these features that is
possible to implement in the specified timeframe.
System requirements:
1. The web application is intended to be used on desktop. Minimum screen
resolution: 1024x768.
2. The following browsers should be supported: latest versions of Google Chrome
(Windows and Mac), Mozilla Firefox (all platforms), Microsoft Edge.
Technologies:
1. Language: Typescript.
2. You should use React without stock components.
The general idea is to avoid using readymade solutions, so that we can fully
assess how you design and engineer solutions in the scope of a small task like
this.
3. If your project requires building, provide the necessary instructions.
As a bonus, you can implement a few optional features:
I. Entering/editing note text.
II. Moving notes to front (in case of overlapping notes).
